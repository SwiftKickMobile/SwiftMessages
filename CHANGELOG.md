# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [3.3.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.3.3)

### Bug Fixes
* Fix an issue where rapidly showing and hiding messages could result in messages becoming orphaned on-screen.

## [3.3.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.3.2)

### Improvements
* `MessageView` is smarter about including additional accessibility views for cases where you've added accessible elements to the view. Previously only the `button` was included. Now all views where `isAccessibilityElement == true`.

    Note that all nib files now have `isAccessibilityElement == false` for `titleLabel`, `bodyLabel` and `iconLabel` (`titleLabel` and `bodyLabel` are read out as part of the overall message view's text). If any of these need to be directly accessible, then copy the nib file into your project and select "Enabled" in the Accessibility section of the Identity Inspector.

## [3.3.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.3.1)

### Bug Fixes
* Fix regression where the UI was being blocked when using `DimMode.none`.

## [3.3.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.3.0)

### Features
* Add proper support for VoiceOver. See the [Accessibility section](README.md#accessibility) of the readme.

## [3.2.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.2.1)

### Bug Fixes
* Fix infinite loop bug introduced in 3.2.0.

## [3.2.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.2.0)

### Features
* Added the ability to display messages for an indefinite duration while enforcing a minimum duration using `Duration.indefinite(delay:minimum)`.

This option is useful for displaying a message when a process is taking too long but you don't want to display the message if the process completes in a reasonable amount of time.
         
For example, if a URL load is expected to complete in 2 seconds, you may use the value `unknown(delay: 2, minimum 1)` to ensure that the message will not be displayed most of the time, but will be displayed for at least 1 second if the operation takes longer than 2 seconds. By specifying a minimum duration, you can avoid hiding the message too fast if the operation finishes right after the delay interval.

### Bug Fixes
* Prevent views below the dim view from receiving accessibility focus.
* Prevent taps in the message view from hiding when using interactive dim mode.
* Fix memory leak of single message view

## [3.1.5](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.5)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix memory leak of `MessageViews`.

## [3.1.4](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.4)

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue where UIKit components were being instantiated off the main queue.

## [3.1.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.3)

### Features

* Added the ability to set a custom value on `MessageView.id`. This can be useful for dismissing specific messages using a pre-defined `id`.

## [3.1.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.2)

### Features

* Changed the default behavior when a message is displayed in its own window (such as with `.window` presentation context) to no longer become the key window in order to prevent the keyboard from dismissing. If one needs the message's window to become key, this can be done by setting `SwiftMessages.Config.becomeKeyWindow` to `true`. See 

### Bug Fixes

* Changed the internal logic of hiding a message view to always succeed to work around the problem of the hide animation failing, such as when started while the app is not active.
* Improved reliability of the automatic adjustments made to avoid message views overlapping the status bar, particularly when using the `.view` presentation context.

## [3.1.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.1)

### Features

* Added a `view` case to `presentationContext` for displaying the message in a specific container view.

## [3.1.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.1.0)

### Features

* Add `eventListeners` option to `SwiftMessages.Config` to specify a list of event listeners to be notified of message show and hide events.

## [3.0.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.0.3)

### Features

* Add `ignoreDuplicates` option to `SwiftMessages.Config` to specify whether or not to ignore duplicate `Identifiable` message views.

## [3.0.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.0.2)

### Features

* Add `shouldAutorotate` option to `SwiftMessages.Config` for customizing device rotation behavior when messages are presented in an overlay window. By default, message will auto-rotate.

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.0.1)

### Improvements

* Enable automatic provisioning on framework target

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/3.0.0)

### Breaking Changes

* Support for Swift 3.0.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/2.0.0)

### Breaking Changes

* Support for Swift 2.3 and Xcode 8.

  The nib files needed to be updated to Xcode 8 format to work 
  around an iOS bug. Unfortunately, this makes it necessary 
  to break backward compatibility with Swift 2.2 and Xcode 7.

## [1.1.4](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.4)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix #16 Preserve status bar visibility when displaying message in a new window.

## [1.1.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.3)

### Features

* Add default configuration `SwiftMessages.defaultConfig` that can be used when calling the variants of `show()` that don't take a `config` argument or as a global base for custom configs.
* Add `Array.sm_random()` function that returns a random element from the array. Can be used to create a playful
     message that cycles randomly through a set of emoji icons, for example.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix #5 Emoji not shown!
* Fix #6 There is no way to create SwiftMessages instance as there is no public initializer

## [1.1.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.2)

### Bug Fixes

* Fix Carthage-related issues.

## [1.1.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.1)

### Features

* New layout `Layout.TabView` â€” like `Layout.CardView` with one end attached to the super view.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix spacing between title and body text in `Layout.CardView` when body text wraps.

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.1.0)

### Improvements

### API Changes

* The `BaseView.contentView` property of was removed because it no longer had any functionality in the framework.

    This is a minor backwards incompatible change. If you've copied one of the included nib files from a previous release, you may get a key-value coding runtime error related to contentView, in which case you can subclass the view and add a `contentView` property or you can remove the outlet connection in Interface Builder.

## [1.0.3](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.2)

### Improvements

* Remove the `iconContainer` property from `MessageView`.

### Bug Fixes

* Fix constraints generated by `BaseView.installContentView()`.

## [1.0.2](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.2)

### Features

* Add support for specifying an `IconStyle` in the `MessageView.configureTheme()` convenience function.

## [1.0.1](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.1)

* Add code comments.

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/SwiftKickMobile/SwiftMessages/releases/tag/1.0.0)

* Initial release.
